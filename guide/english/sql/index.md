## SQL

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is the most common tool used to manipulate and manage data in a relational database (often referred to as a "SQL database").

SQL is commonly pronounced "sequel." Its most popular variants are MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite - a version of SQL which is commonly used for prototyping. It introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command, using SQL Queries.

SQL can be broken down further into DDL (Data Definition Language) and  DML (Data manipulation Language). DDL is the creating/editing the structure of tables and DDL is selecting data, inserting data, updating data, and deleting data.

Another common acronym in SQL is CRUD (Create/Insert, Read/Select, Update, Delete)
